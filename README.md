# Predicting Obesity: Not a Piece of Cake

## Dataset
- We used the 2014 Respondent File from the (Eating & Health (EH) Module of the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) from 2014)[https://www.kaggle.com/bls/eating-health-module-dataset#ehresp_2014.csv]

## Notebooks
- The entirety of our code is in Jupyter Notebooks. We used default Python packages, with the addition of `sklearn` and `graphviz` (which is best installed via `conda install python-graphviz`).
- To run these notebooks, ensure the path pointing to the dataset is correct and that the necessary packages are installed. Some notebooks may take upwards of 30 minutes to execute, depending on processing power.
